# Music Portal

Welcome to the Music Portal project! This application allows users to stream music using the Deezer API, manage playlists, and discover new tracks.

## Installation Process

To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/martha-555/my-app.git
   cd music-portal
   ```
2. Install dependencies: Run the following command to install the required packages: `npm install`
3. Start the frontend: After installing the dependencies, start the application: `npm start`
4. Set up the backend: You need to start the backend server as well. Clone the backend repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/martha-555/music-backend.git
  cd music-backend
```

5. Install backend dependencies: Run the following command in the backend directory: `npm install`
   6.Start the backend server: Start the backend server on port 3001: `npm start`

Now your frontend will be able to make requests to the backend server running on port 3001.

## Usage

Once both servers are running, you can access the Music Portal in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. Enjoy exploring music and managing your playlists!
